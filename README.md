WAT (web archive transform) metadata mining

## ABOUT 
A collection of pig scripts for performing web archive analysis tasks. The scripts rely on Apache Hadoop and Pig Latin and make use of the [archive-metadata-extractor](https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Iresearch/archive-metadata-extractor.jar) library.

## FILES
* '/src/pig/' contains pig scripts that can be run against wat files (or folders containing them), which can reside locally or on an hdfs file system.   
* '/src/resouces/sh' contains shell scripts that can be used to automate tasks like calling the wat extraction tool or desplaying the result files generated by Hadoop.
* '/src/resouces/grunt' contains small example input files and pig statements, which is usefull for experimentation using pig's grunt shell.
